# Route Manager Examples
* Getting started: https://github.com/thequinndev/docolate/wiki/Route-Manager-%E2%80%90-Getting-Started

## Endpoints (Routes)

``./endpoints``

Start here to see an example of how to build endpoints.
* Refer to the docs for more info: https://github.com/thequinndev/docolate/wiki/Docolate-%E2%80%90-Route-Manager

## OpenAPI

* ``./openapi/manager`` - OpenAPIManager example
* ``./openapi/compiler`` - OpenAPISpecCompiler example

Go here next to see how the endpoints can be built into a working OpenAPI spec. Just like the one here: https://github.com/thequinndev/docolate/blob/main/examples/route-manager/openapi/openapi.json
* Refer to the docs for more info: https://github.com/thequinndev/docolate/wiki/Docolate-%E2%80%90-OpenAPI-Manager

## Express Example

``./express``

Just for fun, an example of how the endpoints can be (easily) mapped to the Express router to add 100% type-safety.
